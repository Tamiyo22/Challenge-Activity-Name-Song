# Challenge-Activity-Name-Song

Modify secondVerse to play "The Name Game" (a.k.a. "The Banana Song", see OxfordDictionaries.com), by replacing "(Name)" with userName but without the first letter. Ex: If userName = "Katie", the program prints:
Banana-fana fo-fatie!
Note: The song verse may change, such as: Banana-fana fo-f(Name)!!!
